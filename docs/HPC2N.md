As mentioned in the [Resources](3.%20Resources.md) tab, you can also access HPC2N resources. Comprehensive documentation on how to use and access HPC2N is available [here](https://docs.hpc2n.umu.se/). Below you will find information on how to get started.

### SUPR/NAISS account

Since HPC2N is under the SUPR/NAISS umbrella, the first step is to get a NAISS account. To do that 

*   Go to the account registration of NAISS: [https://supr.naiss.se/person/register](https://supr.naiss.se/person/register) (skip if you already have an account)
*   Select "Register with Federated Identity"

*   Select **Ume√• University** (or other if relevant)

*   Login with your credentials. If that step does not work, please get in touch. Otherwise proceed to the next step.

### Request access to a project

In order for you to access the services, you need to be a member of a project. In most cases, this will be something that your PI or the facility will have created for you. To request access to a project 

*   Once logged in on [SUPR/NAISS](https://supr.naiss.se), click on the [Project link](https://supr.naiss.se/project) in the left menu

*   Request Membership of a relevant project. You can look for projects assigned to PIs by searching the PIs name. 

*   You will be granted access once your PI or the facility approves the request.

*   Get in touch if anything of the above fails, otherwise proceed to the next step once you have gotten confirmation by email that you have been added to the project.

### HPC2N account

*   Once logged in in [SUPR/NAISS](https://supr.naiss.se), click on the [Accounts link](https://supr.naiss.se/account) in the left menu
*   In the section "Account Request" you will see your name listed next to Kebnekaise at HPC2N. Click on **Request Account**

*   You will be contacted by HPC2N by email once your account is ready. They will let you know your username and password. This usually takes a few days as they make new accounts once a week.
