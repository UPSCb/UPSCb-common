# Pipeline 

While most of the standard anlaysis in the facility is now done using [Nextflow](5.%20nextflow.md) pipelines, we still have our own framework of scripts that we use for some steps of a standard analysis or for some non-standard analysis. This resource hosted on [Github](https://github.com/UPSCb/UPSCb-common/tree/master/pipeline) contains scripts written (mostly) in bash that you can copy into your project and used through the [SLURM](3.%20Resources.md#further-reading) queueing system. Most of these scripts rely on [containers](3.%20Resources.md).
