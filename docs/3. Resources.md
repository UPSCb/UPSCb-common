# Resources

## Server Infrastructure

At UPSCb we have our own servers for both computation and storage. We also use regional and national resources.

### Local

Our on-site machines are used for both computation and storage. A few names you will come across frequently are `riboexplorer`, `aspseq` and `microasp`. All of these machines are accessed via `ssh`(more information on accessing these can be found in the [Onboarding](2.%20Onboarding.md) tab).

### National/Regional

High Performance Computing Center North (HPC2N) offers an Open On Demand system to request and use their resources. We will help you gain access to this resource and provide intial training to use it. There are several such computing centers in Sweden operating under the National Academic Infrastructure for SuperÂ­computing in Sweden (NAISS) umbrella. Access to these can be discussed according to the computational needs of individual projects. 

## Further reading
Depending on your experience you may not be familiar with resources and terms we use frequently. Here you will find information to learn about these resources.

1. **Git**: 
    - In technical terms: Git is a version control system (VCS) used to track changes to your source code. You can learn more about Git [here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/). 
    - Learn about Git in not-so tech terms: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/pymrss/comment/hey5be7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

2. **Github**: [GitHub](https://github.com) hosts public and private code documented using Git. 

3. **R and R-studio**: R (programming language) and R-Studio (an integrated development environment for R) are important tools that are used frequently in UPSCb data anlaysis pipelines. If you are not familiar with R and want to learn basic principles of R, please go through these resources: [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/), [discovR](https://www.discovr.rocks/discovr/)

4. **SLURM**: It is a queueing system meant to ensure the concurrent and fair use of a compute cluster. You can learn more about SLURM and SLURM commands like `sbatch` and `squeue` [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html)

5. **Containers**: As the name suggests, containers allow code for target tools/applications to be packaged and isolated (in other words: contained) alongwith their dependecies. In practice, it makes it easy for different users to run the tools consistently regardless of their run environment. A video explaination can be found [here](https://umeauniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/edpi0005_ad_umu_se/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fedpi0005%5Fad%5Fumu%5Fse%2FDocuments%2Fsummary%5Fserver%5Fintroduction%2Fvideo%5Fapptainer%5Fcontainers%2Emp4&referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview%2Ee0daaf76%2Dddbf%2D4cb4%2Dbc6c%2Dd8dd2a449b7e)
