# Onboarding

These instructions are specific to the users at the UmeÃ¥ Plant Science Centre, you are welcome to get inspired by them though.

## Access

Your data analysis journey starts with you contacting us regarding your project to discuss how much storage and computing power you might need. We have quotas with storage limited to 1000GB/project and 50GB/user which often means that the end user (you) need to be well versed with good practices for resource management.

After you have contact us, we will set up your account and we will ask you to follow the instructions seen in this [video](https://youtu.be/hYtIKIIwRss) to finish setting up your account.

>!!! Note 
We use key based authentication for access to the servers. Once your key has been authenticated you do not need password to access the server. However, access to R-Studio is password protected. You will get a password from us which you can use for initial log-in. Changing your password after the first log-in is recommended. 

<details>
    <summary> To change your password follow these steps on your terminal or PowerShell </summary>
        ```
        ssh <username>@micro
        passwd
        -Enter current password-
        -Enter New Password-
        -Confirm New Password-
        ```
    </details>

## Setup your project
Before you start analysing data make sure to get familiar with the [Resources](3.%20Resources.md) at your disposal. In addition to the information on that page, know that we use `git` and `SLURM` to ensure reproducible research, here are gists on how to use them in your projects:

1.  [Git setup](https://gist.github.com/nicolasDelhomme/46a1053d277510b95692318bd1732b6d)
2.  [SLURM usage](https://gist.github.com/nicolasDelhomme/6fbff1e4db3c7ee4b3bb4f710667fd0d)
          
          
We recommend you watch this [video](https://youtu.be/3XMHTixiszE) of a tech seminar (duration \~1h) on how to set up your project. Here are some key moments from the video:

- One of the first things to do after you have access to our servers is to copy the [UPSCb-common](https://github.com/UPSCb/UPSCb-common) GitHub repository in yor home directory on the server. This repository contains most basic scripts and utilities you will need to analyse your data. Steps to clone the repository are in the video starting [here](https://youtu.be/3XMHTixiszE?t=849)
- Using ssh keys with your GitHub account > [here](https://youtu.be/3XMHTixiszE?t=1353)
- Introduction to `SLURM` and how to use it > [here](https://youtu.be/3XMHTixiszE?t=3017)

While this video uses R-Studio as an example, you can use VSCode as a substitute.

## Server usage

A comprehensive guide outlining how to access and use our servers properly is [here](server_introduction.html)

>!!! WARNING
Use R-Studio/Aspseq only for data exploration and visualization. Loading heavy data sets or performing memory intensive tasks like sequence alignments etc. will break the server. 
All steps before this should be done using **`bash`**.
