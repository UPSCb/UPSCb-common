	Usage: $0 <output dir> <masked dna file path> <input dna file path> <input pep file path> <exon mask file path> <PBS?>

		- <output dir>: the directory where the output files will be created

		- <input dna dir>: contains a file named dna_rm.fa, which is entire repeat masked dna from that species, 
		and a list file for all unmasked dna divided into different chromosomes in FASTA format;

		- <input pep dir>: contains a FASTA file for all the proteins in the species;

		- <exon mask dir>: contains a list of files named \"chr_exLocs\", \"chr2_exLocs\", etc. to specify exons coordinates, one for each chromosome. 
		Only thing matters for these files are their third and fourth columns, which should be start and end coordinates of exons.

		- <PBS> : 0 if, 1 if.
